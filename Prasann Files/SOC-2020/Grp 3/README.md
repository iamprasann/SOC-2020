## Changes from report

Everything required to know about this project is mentioned in the report, but we made some changes after final submission to come up with a better project which are as follows:

The initial final submission we gave is: **running_project.py**
which gave the results: **first-trial-by-tsv.txt**
From the results, we realised that after a few songs the songs started repeating since our library had only 60 songs.Thus we came up with another one: **updated-running.py**


After a few more commits on updated-running.py we came up on the final music pattern interpreter which did not repeat songs, did not get stuck between two songs(this happened in one of the versions of updated-running.py) and interpreted the songs in a pretty good manner.
